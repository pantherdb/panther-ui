The PANTHER (<span class="panther">P</span>rotein <span class="panther">AN</span>alysis <span class="panther">TH</span>rough <span class="panther">E</span>volutionary <span class="panther">R</span>elationships) Classification System was designed to classify proteins (and their genes) in order to facilitate high-throughput analysis. Proteins have been classified according to:

*   Family and subfamily: families are groups of evolutionarily related proteins; subfamilies are related proteins that also have the same function
*   Molecular function: the function of the protein by itself or with directly interacting proteins at a biochemical level, e.g. a protein kinase
*   Biological process: the function of the protein in the context of a larger network of proteins that interact to accomplish a process at the level of the cell or organism, e.g. mitosis.
*   Pathway: similar to biological process, but a pathway also explicitly specifies the relationships between the interacting molecules.

The PANTHER Classifications are the result of human curation as well as sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. Details of the methods can be found in ([Mi et al. NAR 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23193289); [Thomas et al., Genome Research 2003](http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/13/9/2129)).

PANTHER is part of the [Gene Ontology Phylogenetic Annotation Project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21873635).  

PANTHER is supported by research grants from the National Human Genome Research Institute and the National Science Foundation, and maintained by the [Thomas lab at the University of Southern California](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/thomaslab).  

Version 13.1 (released 2018-02-03) contains 15524 protein families, divided into 79562 functionally distinct protein subfamilies.
